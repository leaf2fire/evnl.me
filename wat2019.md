# Write AnyThing

## WAT 2019

##### 2019.5.19

###### 2019.5.19.1

It finally begins. By it, I mean my site, hopes, and dreams. Well, actually I
have no idea what it will be, but I'll at least be writing some stuff.

I've been blocking myself by over complicating the process. I wanted a site that
looks good and functions perfectly when all I really needed to get started is
really a single text file. I've begun and hope to go for the long run.

###### 2019.5.19.2

I've tried making stuff before. I wanted to make high quality content when I
could barely come up with it. Discouraged, I ended up stopping.

But now I care less about quality, at least in this context, and more about the
ideas that pop in my head. That's why I call this "Write AnyThing" or "WAT".

###### 2019.5.19.3

I actually wanted to specially format my data into a database of some sort. I
have decided to do that later and simply tag each idea with an ID. This one is
"2019.5.19.3".

I hope to refer to my previous ideas by these IDs in the future. Later on, if
the need arises, I can easily do some text processing on this file and store its
contents into a database.

###### 2019.5.19.4

Just to remind myself, I want to do weekly reviews and definitely yearly
reviews.

###### 2019.5.19.5

In case I lose my memory, I use Arch (Linux) by the way. I also use Emacs.

I often tend to overthink things, but to me, that's what it means to be prepared
for almost any situation. And then I miss an edge case and everything blows up
anyways.

###### 2019.5.19.6

One of my purposes for WAT is to document my daily observations which
basically. Since I use Google to answer a lot of my questions, I can only assume
Google is already doing that for me. Anyways, basically, any question or idea I
have ever asked or thought of will go here.

###### 2019.5.19.7

[WAT]

WAT is intended to be primarily an append only sort of log aka diary. I might
mention the same idea at different points in time, so I'll probably want to tag
ideas when possible. If something like this `[a,b,c]` appears after the idea ID
(e.g. 2019.5.19.7), each element in the list is a tag.

###### 2019.5.19.8

[git, GitHub, push]

I almost dismissed the fact that I had some trouble pushing to GitHub. The error
message I got when I tried to pushing to `origin master` is `push declined due
to email privacy restrictions`. I [solved
this](https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/push-declined-due-to-email-privacy-restrictions/m-p/12755/highlight/true#M4143)
by unchecking the box in my settings that says "Block command line pushes that
expose my email". My email being exposed currently isn't a concern for me. I'll
deal with it when it is, which may involve changing or creating a new email or
complicated filters.

###### 2019.5.19.9

[clarity]

When I said "solved this", this refers to my particular case. I can't claim
credit for the solution. In the future, I'll just directly reference the
particular resource to keep things clear.

###### 2019.5.19.10

[time management, rules]

Just now, I think I'm spending too much time writing and it's eating into my
doing time. I'll set a rule that prioritizes doing over writing and writing over
mindlessly browsing the internet.

###### 2019.5.19.11

[me]

I often wonder who and what I am. What make me, me. Right now, if I had to
describe myself in one breath it would be a person who optimizes how he
experiences his every day life. From certain perspectives, you could say I'm
a person who controls his reality.

##### 2019.5.20

###### 2019.5.20.1

[cooking]

I let the grease on my nonstick pan solidify and now it's a sticky pan. I
should've washed the pan immediately and will do that from now on. Solid grease
is a pain to clean.

###### 2019.5.20.2

[cooking, cooking oil]

I realized when I was cooking eggs this morning that the reason the oil
splatters sometimes is because the oil there is too much oil in one place. To
reduce splattering, I need to coat the pan with a thin and even layer of
oil. This can be achieved on nonstick pans by using an oil spray.

Right now, I only have the kind that uses compressed gas to spray. I hope to get
a manual one that I can refill with whatever liquid oil I want.

If I'm cooking eggs on a nonstick pan, oil spray is the way to go.

###### 2019.5.20.3

[cooking oil]

I wonder why SAM THE COOKING GUY uses avocado oil sometimes. Maybe for the high
heat cooking he frequently does?

I've heard that refined oils are comparatively worse than unrefined oils when it
comes to health. I can believe that, but it is hard to even find unrefined oils
in the first place. For myself, I'll stick with whatever I can find in the
market and use them in moderation.

The
[people](https://happilyunprocessed.com/the-basics/refined-oils-and-why-you-should-never-eat-them/)
who advocate for the use of unrefined oils tend to also
[commit](https://www.100daysofrealfood.com/problem-refined-oils/) to an organic,
all natural diet.

[healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-vegetable-and-seed-oils-bad#section7)
says I should stay away from hydrogenated oils. This seems doable.

I also should get smaller, possibly higher quality, bottles of oil. It already
takes me quite a long time to get through medium sized bottles

According to
[eatbydate.com](https://www.eatbydate.com/other/condiments/how-long-does-oil-last/),
canola oil lasts for a year and olive oil 2 to 3 years. Perhaps, it's too early
to worry about my oil going bad. They're only about a month and half old.

[cooking, roasted almonds]

According to most sites such as
[rachelcooks.com](https://www.rachelcooks.com/2014/03/09/olive-oil-roasted-almonds/),
almonds should be roasted at 350 degrees F for about 7 to 15 minutes. They are
generally roasted with olive oil and seasoned with sea salt and cayenne pepper.

###### 2019.5.21.2

[myfitnesspal]

myfitnesspal is pretty good for counting calories, but I can't specify how much
I eat in grams. I can only say a ratio of the serving size. Another problem I
have is that I can't specify food groups. The closest thing they have is
meals. This is a lesser problem though.

###### 2019.5.21.3

[cooking, breadcrumbs]

I've heard from SAM THE COOKING GUY that breadcrumbs can be used in meat paddies
and meat balls. What exactly is the role of the breadcrumbs? I've only really
seen it used as breading when it comes to frying and baking.

[epicurious.com](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/15-ways-to-use-breadcrumbs-article)
describes 15 ways to use breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs' primary role is to be a
texture enhancer. It also has the ability to be a thickener, filler, and binder
in soups, meatballs, and crab cakes.

##### 2019.5.22

###### 2019.5.22.1

[myfitnesspal]

I mentioned yesterday how I couldn't get myfitnesspal to specify my serving
sizes in grams. Turns out, it does have that capability. The startup is still
pretty slow though.

###### 2019.5.22.2

[homes, rent]

Yesterday night, I was thinking about buying a condo instead of renting an
apartment. I can definitely see myself live around the neighborhood I'm
currently in by the time I finish paying a 15 year mortgage.

The reason why I'm considering buying is because I don't plan to take advantage
of the fact that I'm renting.

[Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/personal-finance/rent-vs-buy)
discusses this common rent vs buy scenario.

Things that I'm looking for include a gas stove with ventilation, smooth and
easy to clean counter tops, no lawn to maintain, a heating system more efficient
than electric baseboards, a smart thermostat, being walkable distance to work
and grocery stores, and no carpet.

After half a day, I realize the things I'm looking for aren't exclusive to
buying a home. So unless monthly expenses between renting and buying are
comparable, I'll probably stick with renting.

###### 2019.5.22.3

[routine]

I need a routine to do right after work. I don't have one right now. Well, I
used to and that was cooking and eating. I moved the cooking and eating to the
morning to free up time after work. Now my nights are pretty empty.

So what's the routine? Let's make it a bit of writing and a bit of memorizing
and perhaps a bit of reading. I should slide in a workout or two in the
beginning so I can use my fitness subscription (Saturno Movement) and minimize
sleep disruption. After all that, I should have a bit of time to relax and do
whatever I want and then go to sleep.

[egg shell, calcium supplement]

[tiphero.com](https://tiphero.com/eggshell-calcium-powder) tells us how to make
egg shell powder. There are four main steps.

1. Rinse the egg shell.
2. Boil the shells for 10 minutes.
3. Bake the shells at 200 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes.
4. Grind them up.

Unless you have no calcium in your diet, try not to take more than half a
teaspoon or 2.5 grams per day. This amount should fulfill the recommended daily
value of calcium which is about 1000mg. Egg shells are about 40% calcium.

[healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eggshells-benefits-and-risks)
outlines some benefits and risks involved with egg shells.

As far as most supplements are concerned including calcium powder, for better
absorption, take the supplement with your meals and spread the supplement over
the day instead of taking it all at once.

###### 2019.5.23.2

[retirement]

I wish to serve more than one patron of my choosing of course. Right now, there
are very few powerful patrons (companies) monopolizing our time. I'm bound by
the shackles of I'm dependent on one company just to live. That wording is sort
of weird but I'll go with it.

Anyways, I was trying to calculate the number of years you need to save and how
much in order for you to live solely off capital gains. I ended up coming across
arithmeticoâ€“geometric sequence
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetico%E2%80%93geometric_sequence))
trying to crunch the numbers. It helped immensely and was much more effective
than eigen decomposition.

After doing the math, my conclusions are once you manage to save more than you
spend saving more only pushes retirement a few years closer at most. It's still
going to take a long time, unless you can increase the amount you save by an
order of magnitude.

Live comfortably and don't worry about increasing your rate of saving.

[brokerage, investing]

How do I compare brokerages?

[nerdwallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/online-broker-comparison)
has a list.

And the winner is Vanguard for Vanguard related trading and probably Ally or
Fidelity for everything else.

##### 2019.5.25

###### 2019.5.25.1

[buffets]

I ate way too much at an Indian buffet called Kanishka today. I need to remind
myself to prioritize quality over quantity. I need to remind myself to listen to
my stomach. And always save room for desert and end a meal satisfied and not
full.

Right now, I'm paying the consequences of overeating hours after the incident. I
do love food, I do, but I want to enjoy the other aspects of my life.

###### 2019.5.25.2

[Amazon Prime]

I realized a lot of my friends have Amazon Prime. I always thought it was like
90 dollars per month, but that is actually closer to the yearly cost.

I'm fine with waiting extra for my shipments, but when does waiting become
procrastination?

Waiting becomes procrastination when you have the opportunity to do something
earlier but wait to do it.

Anyways, my conclusion about Amazon Prime is it's worth it if you order at least
once per month. In my case, it's a clear yes. I've been ordering about twice a
month since moving and expect to order half that much once I'm completely
settled in, coming to once a month.

I'll probably start with the trial on my next purchase and subscribe at the end.

[cooking, potato wedges]

I made parmesan potato wedges based off this recipe from
[tasteofhome.com](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/parmesan-potato-wedges/).

Seasoning used on 415g of potatoes.

* 1 tsp each of garlic powder and salt
* 1/2 tsp each of oregano, paprika, cayenne, and onion powder
* a handful of grated parmesan cheese
* a bunch of finely chopped parsley stems
* olive oil for brushing potatoes

I used up all the parsley but I ended having extra of the spices and cheese.

I found the end result too salty, so I'll probably reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp or
1/4 tsp next time or perhaps do away with it completely and only add it to
taste.

I baked the potatoes in a baking tray. The tray I had unexpectedly warped; I
might have to get a higher quality one if the tray continues to warp beyond a
certain point.

I cooked the wedges on both sides 15 minutes each at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. The
wedges, I feel, were overcooked. Maybe, reducing the total bake time to 25
minutes would be better.

A lot of the seasoning and parsley that didn't end up sticking to wedges ended
up being overcooked and pretty close to burning. I don't think I can preserve
the parsley's green color even if I reduced its cook time. Putting it in fresh
doesn't make much sense to me either.

[cooking, cheese, grating]

Which part of the cheese do you grate first? The harder part. The softer part
tends to crumble more.

###### 2019.5.27.2

[cooking, falafel]

Ingredients

* 200g chickpeas (dry), soak overnight
* 133g yellow onion
* About 1 cup roughly chopped parsley
* About 1/2 cup grated parmesan
* 3 minced cloves of garlic

Binder

* 2 large eggs

Seasoning

* 1 tsp each of salt, pepper, cumin, coriander, cayenne, paprika
* a generous pinch of cardamon
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1/2 tsp sugar

Bake at 350 degree Fahrenheit for 25 minutes.

I forgot to grease the pan and add the parmesan to the first half. I'm kind of
disappointed.

I added parmesan, 1/2 tbsp of flour, and some olive oil to the second batch.

###### 2019.5.27.3

[cooking, parsley, chicken]

* 400g chicken
* 1 cup roughly chopped parsley including stems
* 1 tsp lemon zest
* 2 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 4 cloves minced garlic
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp rice wine (sake)
* 1 quarter lime juice

It's pretty good. It could've used less salt though.

This was inspired by
[chimichurri](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/traditional-chimichurri).

###### 2019.5.27.4

[cooking, sauces, oil]

I realize that a lot of sauces have a lot of oil and fat. How do I reduce the
amount of fats without making it too dry? Maybe I'll just try using less and see
what happens.

###### 2019.5.27.5

[time management]

I need to make sure I do the things I want or need to do before I forget
it. Doing things as soon as possible is the easiest way to do it. Assuming the
thing you're doing is within your ability of course.

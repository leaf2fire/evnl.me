# Write AnyThing

## WAT 2019

###### 2019.5.19.1

It finally begins. By it, I mean my site, hopes, and dreams. Well, actually I
have no idea what it will be, but I'll at least be writing some stuff.

I've been blocking myself by over complicating the process. I wanted a site that
looks good and functions perfectly when all I really needed to get started is
really a single text file. I've begun and hope to go for the long run.

###### 2019.5.19.2

I've tried making stuff before. I wanted to make high quality content when I
could barely come up with it. Discouraged, I ended up stopping.

But now I care less about quality, at least in this context, and more about the
ideas that pop in my head. That's why I call this "Write AnyThing" or "WAT".

###### 2019.5.19.3

I actually wanted to specially format my data into a database of some sort. I
have decided to do that later and simply tag each idea with an ID. This one is
"2019.5.19.3".

I hope to refer to my previous ideas by these IDs in the future. Later on, if
the need arises, I can easily do some text processing on this file and store its
contents into a database.

###### 2019.5.19.4

Just to remind myself, I want to do weekly reviews and definitely yearly
reviews.

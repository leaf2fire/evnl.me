# Write AnyThing

I log (append) things I do, discover, and decide here.

## WAT 2019

##### 2019.5.19

###### 2019.5.19.1

It finally begins. By it, I mean my site, hopes, and dreams. Well, actually I
have no idea what it will be, but I'll at least be writing some stuff.

I've been blocking myself by over complicating the process. I wanted a site that
looks good and functions perfectly when all I really needed to get started is
really a single text file. I've begun and hope to go for the long run.

###### 2019.5.19.2

I've tried making stuff before. I wanted to make high quality content when I
could barely come up with it. Discouraged, I ended up stopping.

But now I care less about quality, at least in this context, and more about the
ideas that pop in my head. That's why I call this "Write AnyThing" or "WAT".

###### 2019.5.19.3

I actually wanted to specially format my data into a database of some sort. I
have decided to do that later and simply tag each idea with an ID. This one is
"2019.5.19.3".

I hope to refer to my previous ideas by these IDs in the future. Later on, if
the need arises, I can easily do some text processing on this file and store its
contents into a database.

###### 2019.5.19.4

Just to remind myself, I want to do weekly reviews and definitely yearly
reviews.

###### 2019.5.19.5

In case I lose my memory, I use Arch (Linux) by the way. I also use Emacs.

I often tend to overthink things, but to me, that's what it means to be prepared
for almost any situation. And then I miss an edge case and everything blows up
anyways.

###### 2019.5.19.6

One of my purposes for WAT is to document my daily observations which
basically. Since I use Google to answer a lot of my questions, I can only assume
Google is already doing that for me. Anyways, basically, any question or idea I
have ever asked or thought of will go here.

###### 2019.5.19.7

[WAT]

WAT is intended to be primarily an append only sort of log aka diary. I might
mention the same idea at different points in time, so I'll probably want to tag
ideas when possible. If something like this `[a,b,c]` appears after the idea ID
(e.g. 2019.5.19.7), each element in the list is a tag.

###### 2019.5.19.8

[git, GitHub, push]

I almost dismissed the fact that I had some trouble pushing to GitHub. The error
message I got when I tried to pushing to `origin master` is `push declined due
to email privacy restrictions`. I [solved
this](https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/push-declined-due-to-email-privacy-restrictions/m-p/12755/highlight/true#M4143)
by unchecking the box in my settings that says "Block command line pushes that
expose my email". My email being exposed currently isn't a concern for me. I'll
deal with it when it is, which may involve changing or creating a new email or
complicated filters.

###### 2019.5.19.9

[clarity]

When I said "solved this", this refers to my particular case. I can't claim
credit for the solution. In the future, I'll just directly reference the
particular resource to keep things clear.

###### 2019.5.19.10

[time management, rules]

Just now, I think I'm spending too much time writing and it's eating into my
doing time. I'll set a rule that prioritizes doing over writing and writing over
mindlessly browsing the internet.

###### 2019.5.19.11

[me]

I often wonder who and what I am. What make me, me. Right now, if I had to
describe myself in one breath it would be a person who optimizes how he
experiences his every day life. From certain perspectives, you could say I'm
a person who controls his reality.

##### 2019.5.20

###### 2019.5.20.1

[cooking]

I let the grease on my nonstick pan solidify and now it's a sticky pan. I
should've washed the pan immediately and will do that from now on. Solid grease
is a pain to clean.

###### 2019.5.20.2

[cooking, cooking oil]

I realized when I was cooking eggs this morning that the reason the oil
splatters sometimes is because the oil there is too much oil in one place. To
reduce splattering, I need to coat the pan with a thin and even layer of
oil. This can be achieved on nonstick pans by using an oil spray.

Right now, I only have the kind that uses compressed gas to spray. I hope to get
a manual one that I can refill with whatever liquid oil I want.

If I'm cooking eggs on a nonstick pan, oil spray is the way to go.

###### 2019.5.20.3

[cooking oil]

I wonder why SAM THE COOKING GUY uses avocado oil sometimes. Maybe for the high
heat cooking he frequently does?

I've heard that refined oils are comparatively worse than unrefined oils when it
comes to health. I can believe that, but it is hard to even find unrefined oils
in the first place. For myself, I'll stick with whatever I can find in the
market and use them in moderation.

The
[people](https://happilyunprocessed.com/the-basics/refined-oils-and-why-you-should-never-eat-them/)
who advocate for the use of unrefined oils tend to also
[commit](https://www.100daysofrealfood.com/problem-refined-oils/) to an organic,
all natural diet.

[healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-vegetable-and-seed-oils-bad#section7)
says I should stay away from hydrogenated oils. This seems doable.

I also should get smaller, possibly higher quality, bottles of oil. It already
takes me quite a long time to get through medium sized bottles

According to
[eatbydate.com](https://www.eatbydate.com/other/condiments/how-long-does-oil-last/),
canola oil lasts for a year and olive oil 2 to 3 years. Perhaps, it's too early
to worry about my oil going bad. They're only about a month and half old.

##### 2019.5.21

###### 2019.5.21.1

[cooking, roasted almonds]

According to most sites such as
[rachelcooks.com](https://www.rachelcooks.com/2014/03/09/olive-oil-roasted-almonds/),
almonds should be roasted at 350 degrees F for about 7 to 15 minutes. They are
generally roasted with olive oil and seasoned with sea salt and cayenne pepper.

###### 2019.5.21.2

[myfitnesspal]

myfitnesspal is pretty good for counting calories, but I can't specify how much
I eat in grams. I can only say a ratio of the serving size. Another problem I
have is that I can't specify food groups. The closest thing they have is
meals. This is a lesser problem though.

###### 2019.5.21.3

[cooking, breadcrumbs]

I've heard from SAM THE COOKING GUY that breadcrumbs can be used in meat paddies
and meat balls. What exactly is the role of the breadcrumbs? I've only really
seen it used as breading when it comes to frying and baking.

[epicurious.com](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/15-ways-to-use-breadcrumbs-article)
describes 15 ways to use breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs' primary role is to be a
texture enhancer. It also has the ability to be a thickener, filler, and binder
in soups, meatballs, and crab cakes.

##### 2019.5.22

###### 2019.5.22.1

[myfitnesspal]

I mentioned yesterday how I couldn't get myfitnesspal to specify my serving
sizes in grams. Turns out, it does have that capability. The startup is still
pretty slow though.

###### 2019.5.22.2

[homes, rent]

Yesterday night, I was thinking about buying a condo instead of renting an
apartment. I can definitely see myself live around the neighborhood I'm
currently in by the time I finish paying a 15 year mortgage.

The reason why I'm considering buying is because I don't plan to take advantage
of the fact that I'm renting.

[Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/personal-finance/rent-vs-buy)
discusses this common rent vs buy scenario.

Things that I'm looking for include a gas stove with ventilation, smooth and
easy to clean counter tops, no lawn to maintain, a heating system more efficient
than electric baseboards, a smart thermostat, being walkable distance to work
and grocery stores, and no carpet.

After half a day, I realize the things I'm looking for aren't exclusive to
buying a home. So unless monthly expenses between renting and buying are
comparable, I'll probably stick with renting.

###### 2019.5.22.3

[routine]

I need a routine to do right after work. I don't have one right now. Well, I
used to and that was cooking and eating. I moved the cooking and eating to the
morning to free up time after work. Now my nights are pretty empty.

So what's the routine? Let's make it a bit of writing and a bit of memorizing
and perhaps a bit of reading. I should slide in a workout or two in the
beginning so I can use my fitness subscription (Saturno Movement) and minimize
sleep disruption. After all that, I should have a bit of time to relax and do
whatever I want and then go to sleep.

##### 2019.5.23

###### 2019.5.23.1

[egg shell, calcium supplement]

[tiphero.com](https://tiphero.com/eggshell-calcium-powder) tells us how to make
egg shell powder. There are four main steps.

1. Rinse the egg shell.
2. Boil the shells for 10 minutes.
3. Bake the shells at 200 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes.
4. Grind them up.

Unless you have no calcium in your diet, try not to take more than half a
teaspoon or 2.5 grams per day. This amount should fulfill the recommended daily
value of calcium which is about 1000mg. Egg shells are about 40% calcium.

[healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eggshells-benefits-and-risks)
outlines some benefits and risks involved with egg shells.

As far as most supplements are concerned including calcium powder, for better
absorption, take the supplement with your meals and spread the supplement over
the day instead of taking it all at once.

###### 2019.5.23.2

[retirement]

I wish to serve more than one patron of my choosing of course. Right now, there
are very few powerful patrons (companies) monopolizing our time. I'm bound by
the shackles of I'm dependent on one company just to live. That wording is sort
of weird but I'll go with it.

Anyways, I was trying to calculate the number of years you need to save and how
much in order for you to live solely off capital gains. I ended up coming across
arithmeticoâ€“geometric sequence
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetico%E2%80%93geometric_sequence))
trying to crunch the numbers. It helped immensely and was much more effective
than eigen decomposition.

After doing the math, my conclusions are once you manage to save more than you
spend saving more only pushes retirement a few years closer at most. It's still
going to take a long time, unless you can increase the amount you save by an
order of magnitude.

Live comfortably and don't worry about increasing your rate of saving.

##### 2019.5.24

###### 2019.5.24.1

[brokerage, investing]

How do I compare brokerages?

[nerdwallet.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/online-broker-comparison)
has a list.

And the winner is Vanguard for Vanguard related trading and probably Ally or
Fidelity for everything else.

##### 2019.5.25

###### 2019.5.25.1

[buffets]

I ate way too much at an Indian buffet called Kanishka today. I need to remind
myself to prioritize quality over quantity. I need to remind myself to listen to
my stomach. And always save room for desert and end a meal satisfied and not
full.

Right now, I'm paying the consequences of overeating hours after the incident. I
do love food, I do, but I want to enjoy the other aspects of my life.

###### 2019.5.25.2

[Amazon Prime]

I realized a lot of my friends have Amazon Prime. I always thought it was like
90 dollars per month, but that is actually closer to the yearly cost.

I'm fine with waiting extra for my shipments, but when does waiting become
procrastination?

Waiting becomes procrastination when you have the opportunity to do something
earlier but wait to do it.

Anyways, my conclusion about Amazon Prime is it's worth it if you order at least
once per month. In my case, it's a clear yes. I've been ordering about twice a
month since moving and expect to order half that much once I'm completely
settled in, coming to once a month.

I'll probably start with the trial on my next purchase and subscribe at the end.

##### 2019.5.26

###### 2019.5.26.1

[cooking, potato wedges]

I made parmesan potato wedges based off this recipe from
[tasteofhome.com](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/parmesan-potato-wedges/).

Seasoning used on 415g of potatoes.

* 1 tsp each of garlic powder and salt
* 1/2 tsp each of oregano, paprika, cayenne, and onion powder
* a handful of grated parmesan cheese
* a bunch of finely chopped parsley stems
* olive oil for brushing potatoes

I used up all the parsley but I ended having extra of the spices and cheese.

I found the end result too salty, so I'll probably reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp or
1/4 tsp next time or perhaps do away with it completely and only add it to
taste.

I baked the potatoes in a baking tray. The tray I had unexpectedly warped; I
might have to get a higher quality one if the tray continues to warp beyond a
certain point.

I cooked the wedges on both sides 15 minutes each at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. The
wedges, I feel, were overcooked. Maybe, reducing the total bake time to 25
minutes would be better.

A lot of the seasoning and parsley that didn't end up sticking to wedges ended
up being overcooked and pretty close to burning. I don't think I can preserve
the parsley's green color even if I reduced its cook time. Putting it in fresh
doesn't make much sense to me either.

##### 2019.5.27

###### 2019.5.27.1

[cooking, cheese, grating]

Which part of the cheese do you grate first? The harder part. The softer part
tends to crumble more.

###### 2019.5.27.2

[cooking, falafel]

Ingredients

* 200g chickpeas (dry), soak overnight
* 133g yellow onion
* About 1 cup roughly chopped parsley
* About 1/2 cup grated parmesan
* 3 minced cloves of garlic

Binder

* 2 large eggs

Seasoning

* 1 tsp each of salt, pepper, cumin, coriander, cayenne, paprika
* a generous pinch of cardamon
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1/2 tsp sugar

Bake at 350 degree Fahrenheit for 25 minutes.

I forgot to grease the pan and add the parmesan to the first half. I'm kind of
disappointed.

I added parmesan, 1/2 tbsp of flour, and some olive oil to the second batch.

###### 2019.5.27.3

[cooking, parsley, chicken]

* 400g chicken
* 1 cup roughly chopped parsley including stems
* 1 tsp lemon zest
* 2 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 4 cloves minced garlic
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp rice wine (sake)
* 1 quarter lime juice

It's pretty good. It could've used less salt though.

This was inspired by
[chimichurri](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/traditional-chimichurri).

###### 2019.5.27.4

[cooking, sauces, oil]

I realize that a lot of sauces have a lot of oil and fat. How do I reduce the
amount of fats without making it too dry? Maybe I'll just try using less and see
what happens.

###### 2019.5.27.5

[time management]

I need to make sure I do the things I want or need to do before I forget
it. Doing things as soon as possible is the easiest way to do it. Assuming the
thing you're doing is within your ability of course.

##### 2019.5.28

###### 2019.5.28.1

[sleeping]

My crotch area tends to overheat towards the end of my sleep. I've tried
changing my mattress, my sheets, and the number of layers. Now it's time to try
better underwear.

###### 2019.5.28.2

[review, time management]

I didn't review last week even though it was on my mind. Let's set a time and
day of the week. Saturday morning sounds good.

##### 2019.5.29

###### 2019.5.29.1

[baking, cornmeal]

If you ever wondered why some breads have cornmeal on the bottom of them, the
cornmeal is used so bakers can easily move and slide the bread after it has
baked. It also gives the bread some extra texture.

###### 2019.5.29.2

[cooking, tortilla]

How do you keep a tortilla thin and the bubbles small when you cook it? Apply
pressure on both sides to keep it flat. What tools are there? I can imagine one
that's similar to a waffle iron. Or a simple heavy flat surface.

Most of these surfaces are cast iron and the most common of them is the bacon
press. I didn't realize bacon was a significant enough that people would name a
tool after it.

Since almost all presses are cast iron, I definitely don't want to use it with
my nonstick pans. If I'm using the press, I'll definitely use it on a cast iron
pan.

###### 2019.5.29.3

[tabouli, parsley, oil substitutes]

I forgot about tabouli. When I first had it, it tasted great but I didn't
realize parsley was a core ingredient. Now I know. I'll definitely make it and
find a way to reduce the oil and fat content.

According to
[livestrong.com](https://www.livestrong.com/article/516908-what-can-i-use-instead-of-olive-oil-to-make-a-salad-dressing-fat-free/),
juices, broths, yogurt, sour cream, vinegar, pectin, and water are potential
substitutes.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectin) says pectin is primarily used
as a gelling agent and is a good source of fiber. Apples, pears, carrots, and
citrus have a lot of pectin.

Speaking of apples, I should regularly include them in my diet.

##### 2019.5.30

###### 2019.5.30.1

[cooking, roasted almonds]

I've found that the outside of the almond when I roast it tends to burn pretty
easily. Also, I ended up burning up the salt and sugar when roasting it, making
my baking sheet a mess. Perhaps, 10 minutes at 350 Fahrenheit is too much. I
admit I didn't attentively watch them during the process.

Here are my proposed changes. First put the soak the almonds in water for a
couple of seconds. Then drain and roast the almonds at 350 Fahrenheit till they
get that deep brown color. I'll figure out the timing by trial and
error. Finally, after roasting, stir in oil, salt, sugar, and other spices in.

I hope that by soaking the almonds for a bit, the outside would cook
slower. Also by only roasting the almonds by itself, the cleanup would be
easier.

###### 2019.5.30.2

[cooking]

I just watched Adam Liaw's [video](https://youtu.be/D8myaMkiZAQ) for [Gong Bao
Ji Ding](http://adamliaw.com/recipe/gong-bao-ji-ding/) and it surprised me that
I actually had almost all of the ingredients. Except for high heat; electric
stoves definitely won't reach the temperatures I want. I will just have to make
this with what I got.

###### 2019.5.30.3

[cooking alcohols]

I wonder how many common types of cooking alcohols there are. I'm surprised no
one has made a comprehensive list. The only ones I could find are on Western
cooking alcohols and aren't particularly
specific. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alcoholic_drinks)
has a pretty long list on alcoholic drinks at least.

Here's my list:

* Sake, Mirin, Shaoxing rice wine
* White wine, Vermouth
* Hard cider
* Beer

##### 2019.5.31

###### 2019.5.31.1

[chocolate]

When I went to feast on some of my chocolate chips, I noticed a slight
discoloration. Just now I discovered that discoloration is what people call a
sugar bloom.

[Lake Champlain
Chocolates](https://www.lakechamplainchocolates.com/how-to-store-chocolate)
suggests that chocolate should be stored between 65 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit at
a humidity of less than 55%. They also advise not to store chocolate in the
fridge.

It has been pretty humid, above 60% at least, this past couple of weeks, so no
wonder my chocolates would be affected.

##### 2019.6.1

###### 2019.6.1.1

[brownies]

While making the chewy brownies from [Handle the
Heat](https://www.handletheheat.com/chewy-brownies/), I learned a lot of
things. I learned that you can get some pretty good chocolate with just sugar,
butter, cocoa powder, egg, and vanilla. Mixing is a bit of mess and my mixing
technique could be improved. I've seen people incorporating fine mesh sieves;
maybe that would help. Also, cutting frozen butter is difficult with just a room
temperature knife. I should've cut up the butter into small pieces before
throwing it into the freezer.

I ate some of the batter that I couldn't get into the pan, and it's super sweet
in a good way. I'm hoping it stores well in the freezer, because I'm not
abandoning my diet just to overeat brownies. I want to enjoy them for as long as
possible.

After cutting up the brownie into bite sized chunks, I noticed that the edges
are definitely overcooked and the interior is slightly undercooked. I wonder how
I can fix this. My toaster oven has a convection mode; perhaps, that would help
at least keep the edges from drying up.

###### 2019.6.1.2

[baked potato]

* 231g russet potato
* about 1/2 tbsp olive oil
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper

I mixed the oil, salt, and pepper and then brushed the mixture on the potato. I
then baked it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 50 minutes.

The baked potato ended up being too salty, so I'll probably halve the salt next
time. The inside was also undercooked, most likely because I cut it open while
it was still cooking. I need to let the potato set a little bit after baking.

I'm going to bump up the bake temperature to 375 or even 425 degrees Fahrenheit
and bake for 45 minutes and let it rest for 5 minutes next time.

###### 2019.6.1.3

[chimichurri, parsley]

I decided to finish off the parsley by making some more chimichurri. I took out
the salt, doubled the lime juice, reduced the oil, and added water.

* 1 cup roughly chopped parsley including stems
* 1 tsp lemon zest
* 2 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper
* 4 cloves minced garlic
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp rice wine (sake)
* 3 tbsp water
* 1/2 lime juiced

###### 2019.6.1.4

[food storage]

What causes green vegetables like green onion and parsley to lose their green
color?

According to
[Ambius](https://www.ambius.com/indoor-plants/why-plants-turn-yellow/), the
reason my vegetables are turning yellow is due to environmental
stress. Moisture, light, temperature, and nutrition are all variables to
consider.

Since it seems I can't control these variables, after all, the vegetables are
meant to eaten, I'll have to plan meals around these time sensitive vegetables
and use at least half of them on the day I get them and the rest over the week.

Carrots, potatoes, onions, garlic, burdock, and cabbage last pretty long, but I
should still try to plan around using them at their freshest.

###### 2019.6.1.5

[review]

After reading the last weeks entries, there are definitely a lot of errors in
terms of language. Extra words, missing words, multiple interpretations and the
like. I'll see if I can become more aware of what I say and how I say it.

I said I'd do this in the morning but night works too.

##### 2019.6.2

###### 2019.6.2.1

[cooking, tortilla]

The flour to water ratio is 8 to 3 for the recipes from [Taste of
Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/homemade-tortillas/) and
[allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/157642/homemade-flour-tortillas/).

Pouring in all the water into the flour was a bad idea. The dough was super
sticky and stuck everywhere. Next time, I'll pour water in gradually until the
dough reaches the what I feel to be the right consistency.

The amounts I used for this iteration of the tortilla is

* 1 cup flour and then some
* 3/8 cup water
* 1 tbsp butter

I think the butter is a bit much and I can probably try using less. I'll want to
do some research into how to make the tortilla chewier. I think kneading plays a
part in it. Surprisingly, it tasted just fine without extra salt.

###### 2019.6.2.2

[cooking, measuring]

I just learned that my rice measuring cup measures 180mL in liquid volume, and
180mL is only 0.761 cups. I always thought that one "cup" of rice is actually
one cup of rice. Turns out I'm wrong.

The volumes of the 1, 2, and 3 cup lines in my rice pot are at about 430mL,
730mL, and 1030mL respectively. So it's about 300mL for each additional cup and
starts with about 130mL extra.

I should make a table of that converts foods measured by volume into grams. Food
such as flour, wheat flour, sugar, butter, rice, and so on.

###### 2019.6.2.3

[butter]

What's the best way to cut butter?

I know that people who work with clay use wires to cut clay. I imagine wires
would be effective for butter too. After searching, the right term seems to be
butter slicer. There are also cheese slicers as well.

##### 2019.6.3

###### 2019.6.3.1

[diet]

I finally got my weight down to 65kg from about 70kg. My weight was as high as
72kg when I first started measuring about 3 months ago.

Initially, my goal was to reach a certain fat percentage, 10% body fat to be
exact, but I later realized that body fat percentage measured by bioelectrical
impedance isn't very accurate. 10% on my scale could be 15% on another scale.

My true goal is to simply just lose body fat and gain muscle mass. That's
it. The numbers should only be there to keep me on track. They aren't the goals
in themselves.

I find it more informative to measure how efficient my weight loss or gain is by
measuring how much of weight lost or gained is fat.

In my case, I went from 72.30kg to 64.80kg total weight and 62.44kg to 57.42kg
fat free weight. According to my calculations, 66.9% of my weight loss is non
fat weight which makes my efficiency for this cut 33.1%. Seems like there's a
lot of room for improvement.

Now that I'm at my goal for my cut, I can finally eat at maintenance. I'm going
to try to hold around 65kg for a week and then increase my calories and go into
my first bulk.

###### 2019.6.3.2

[spices]

I was wondering what else I could make and realized that I haven't made my
favorite spice mix, Nanami Togarashi. Accord to the ingredients label of the
brand I usually use, the spice mix includes chili pepper, orange peel, black and
white sesame seeds, Japanese pepper, ground ginger, and seaweed.

The ingredients used by [Darling
Gourmet](https://www.daringgourmet.com/shichimi-togarashi-and-nanami-togarashi-japanese-seven-spice-blend/)
are chili pepper, orange peel, black and white sesame seeds, sansho or sichuan
peppercorn, ginger, poppy seed, and nori.

Japanese pepper is sansho peppercorn which is similar to sichuan peppercorn.

The ingredients I'm missing are orange peel, poppy seed, ground ginger or ginger
powder, and optionally nori and sansho peppercorn.

I look forward to making this.

###### 2019.6.3.3

[hunger, fasting]

Sometimes I'll think I'm hungry but actually not be. Sounds confusing? Yeah, it
is. That's how I feel when I break my fast for a little snack and end up being
bloated and having more discomfort than the hunger before the snack.

I've done this on numerous occasions, and I still haven't learned my lesson. I
always think maybe there is a food that will satiate my hunger without the
discomfort. I haven't tried miso soup yet. Perhaps, there's a chance. But why
take a chance when I could avoid the added discomfort by sticking with the fast
anyways.

I'll solve this conundrum eventually!

###### 2019.6.3.4

[bread]

I found a lot tips on making bread from
[foodal](https://foodal.com/knowledge/baking/ultimate-guide-to-baking-bread/). Most
of the juice info are linked by the post. They talk about yeast, gluten,
kneading, and more. There is a lot theory behind bread making that is revealed
at Foodal.

[rice]

I can't seem to cook Sekka's medium grain rice properly. I even got a rice
cooker for it, and its texture is still lacking. I'm pretty sure the only
solution is to just use another brand or type of rice.

##### 2019.6.5

[rice]

I mentioned yesterday that Sekka's medium grain rice isn't that great. Last
time, I rinsed two cups (300g) of rice three times and cooked it at the normal
setting. This time I rinsed the rice five times and used a little less
water. I'll want to measure the water more precisely next time, so I can
consistently control that as well.

Rinsing the rice five times and cooking with a bit less water yielded some nice
results. I don't like to rinse too much, because I feel like I'm wasting
water. In actuality, the amount of water I use to rinse rice is small compared
to the water used by the shower, toilet flush, and washing machine. I can
definitely cut my shower time to save water.

I'm currently eating 600 calories (150g) of rice per day. I feel like that is
too much rice, and I want more variety in my diet. I'm going to reduce that to
400 calories (100g) of rice per day.

A good rule of thumb I just made up is that no one food should exceed 20% of
your total daily calories.

###### 2019.6.5.2

[beans]

I wonder how to cook beans, not the canned ones. Last time I looked, cooking
beans is a long, moderately involved process in a pot over the stove. Perhaps, I
can use my Instant Pot for this.

According to
[bonappetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-cook-dried-beans), beans
need to be simmered for 1.5 to 2 hours after soaking. That's a long time to
leave the stove on even on low.

[Mexican Food Journal](https://mexicanfoodjournal.com/how-to-cook-beans/) and
[UNL](https://food.unl.edu/cooking-dry-beans-scratch-can-be-quick) also agree on
the 2 hour simmer time. UNL does mention that some beans may take as little as
45 minutes.

Apparently, beans freeze pretty well which is a plus.

[Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/03/how-to-cook-dried-beans.html)
sees the simmering beans as more of broth that you can season and add aromatics
to.

[The Spicy
Apron](https://thespicyapron.com/recipe/instant-pot-beans-quick-easy/) cooks
beans, specifically black beans, using an Instant Pot. They cooked them at high
pressure for 22 minutes and 5 to 10 minutes natural release.

[Green Health Cooking](https://greenhealthycooking.com/instant-pot-beans/) goes
a step further and includes many different beans and a time scale for how cooked
you want your beans. I'll be following this one when cooking my beans in the
Instant Pot.

I should still try the traditional method in a pot just to compare.

###### 2019.6.5.3

[cream of mushroom]

What's cream of mushroom? Is it powdered mushrooms in a soup

[Cafe Delites](https://cafedelites.com/creamy-mushroom-soup/) has a
recipe. Cream of mushroom consists of mushrooms, fresh herbs, garlic, onions,
cream, stock or broth, and a thickener such as cornstarch or flour. The
mushrooms suggested are brown mushrooms, cremini mushrooms, and mini portebello
mushrooms.

###### 2019.6.5.4

[diet, weight]

The only point maintenance is good for is to transition between cutting and
bulking. Why? Maintenance doesn't help me lose fat or gain muscle, since I'm not
really at deficit nor surplus. Switching too quickly between cutting and fasting
may be difficult to stomach. Maintenance makes that easier, so you don't have to
force yourself to eat more or less.

###### 2019.6.5.5

[dairy product]

I didn't appreciate how many different things we've made from dairy product
until now. The list is extensive and various. Dairy product is definitely one of
the most versatile ingredients up there with soy and flour.

Here's [Wikipedia's page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product) on dairy
products.

##### 2019.6.6

###### 2019.6.6.1

[frozen vegetables]

So far, I've always cooked frozen vegetables one way: boiling. Also, I've only
really cooked edamame. Right now, I have edamame and mustard greens in the
freezer. The question I have is how to cook them. I know I can cook them in
boiling water, but I'm sure there are other ways as well.

##### 2019.6.7

[cash advance]

When you withdraw money from an ATM using a debit card, it's a withdrawal. When
you do that using a credit card, it's a cash advance. A cash advance includes
various fees and interest on top of ATM fees, so if you already have the cash,
use debit rather than credit at the ATM.

[investing]

[JL Collins](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2018/06/07/stocks-part-xxxiii-optimism/)
mentioned VTWSX.

I might want to consider VTWSX. I'm pretty confident international will start
accelerating pretty soon, and I have a hunch that it'll be at full throttle
within the next decade, around 2025 to 2030 maybe.

###### 2019.6.7.5

I tend to overthink the long term and trip over the short term. State space

[spices]

I was surprised to find poppy seed, ginger powder, and orange peel today at my
Fred Meyers. I assumed those spices were limited to Asian grocers. I couldn't
find sansho pepper or good nori though. I need to look for aonori, the powdered
version of nori sheets.

##### 2019.6.9

###### 2019.6.9.1

[steamed fish]

I'm little worried about steaming fish from frozen. I'm pretty sure I should've
thawed it first.

* 168g white fish, pollock
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine
* 1 tsp garlic, finely chopped
* 1 tsp ginger, finely chopped
* 1 tsp fermented black bean, finely chopped
* 1/4 tsp sugar
* some chili peppers, seeds removed
* some sesame oil

It ended up being saltier than I liked plus the fish's color darkened a lot
because of the soy sauce. I'm going to halve the soy sauce amount and add it
later in the steaming process.

###### 2019.6.9.2

[tortilla]

* 1 tbsp (14.2g) butter
* 1 cup (120g) flour
* 3/8 cup (89g) water

Measurement conversion from
[cuisinivity](http://www.cuisinivity.com/guide/measurement.php).

I ended up eating it all again. I should work with smaller portions when I'm
experimenting like this. A quarter of a cup flour should be plenty. I want to
get used to making and kneading dough. Once I master that, I can throw in yeast
and other stuff like butter, milk, yogurt, and eggs.

I finally figured why my dough is always sticky. I keep breaking it and exposing
the dough's sticky interior. I need to be gentler with the dough and not break
its outer shell.

###### 2019.6.9.3

[cleaning]

There is no science behind the baking soda and vinegar combination.

I know the soap I have works. It just isn't effective enough for the hard
greases. I want to solve this problem once and for all. It's definitely a

###### 2019.6.12.1

[cooking, sesame chicken]

I made sesame chicken based off of a recipe I found on [Budget
Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-sesame-chicken/).

Chicken

* 400g chicken
* 1 large egg
* 1 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine
* 2 tsp corn starch

I was hoping for something like beer battered fried chicken. It didn't quite
turn out that way, since I wasn't frying.

Sauce

* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp water
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tsp rice vinegar
* 2 tsp minced garlic
* 1 tsp minced ginger
* 1 tbsp sesame seeds

I shouldn't have put the sesame seeds in the sauce. Putting it in last would
have been better.

It's pretty good overall.

##### 2019.6.13

[frozen edamame]

Apparently you can put frozen edamame right into the stir fry. Defrosting or
putting it in boiling water is optional.

I find measuring out stuck together, frozen edamame a big pain.

If I do or think about something a few minutes or more, it should be logged here. If I'm willing to invest the time, I should at least be aware of what I'm investing it into.

One of the time consuming activities which hasn't been logged is League of Legends. I frequently spend hours on it, yet I haven't quite acknowledged what I'm actually doing.

Isn't sleep also a time consuming activity? One of the biggest of course. I used to log it for sleep quality, but I haven't recently. Sleep shouldn't be an exception. There are many things that go on during sleep. I just need to be more aware of them.

###### 2019.6.16.3

I remember loving pears, and today I ate a ripened pear. It was a bit over ripe in some places, but overall the texture is what I would expect from a pear. I finally figured out when a pear is ripe enough. Check the top and bottom of the pear daily and if it feels "too soft" it's definitely ready. Also, monitor the pear's fragrance. I should eat the pear shortly after its peak fragrance. The idea is the pear should produce a smell while it's ripening and stop when it's done. I haven't tested this yet.

The pear I ate today wasn't quite as enjoyable as I remembered.

###### 2019.6.16.4

I tried baking chicken thighs today. They were pretty thick. I followed the recipe from [The Salty Marshmallow](https://thesaltymarshmallow.com/crispy-baked-chicken-thighs/). Everything was going pretty well until I realized that I was cooking the thighs from half frozen. This plus the thickness of the thighs turned out to be a devastating mistake. The inside was super undercooked.

I'm currently mitigating this mistake by deboning the thighs and baking them for longer. The cleanup is still going to be a pain though.

It took me so long to realize that I made my pancakes using baking soda instead of baking powder. I was completely blind and wondering why my pancakes tasted so salty. Baking soda is a salt by the way.

I need to pay more attention to ingredients listed.

I used a pancake recipe from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/).

Sequence building is active memorization. I need to change my attitude while watching videos. I'm currently sitting back and listening, but it's not active listening. It's very passive. I might be able to get the gist of the video; however, I miss so many details that matter.

The big concepts are great to know. The little details are even better.

###### 2019.6.16.8

The chewiness and heat of brownies, the mildness and crunch of cereal, and the smoothness and cold of ice cream combine to make a very good dessert. It's all about balance. Having many options available too you puts you in control.

If it's too hot, a bite of ice cream. If it's too cold, a bite of brownie. If you need some crunch, a bite of cereal. If you need some chewiness, a bite of brownie. The cycle continues.

##### 2019.6.17

###### 2019.6.17.1

I think I tend to sleep hotter the closer my last meal is to my bedtime. I wonder if there is a study that relates body temperature with meal times.

By sleep hotter, I mean uncomfortable and keeping me awake. This discomfort is yet another reason I eat early.

Perhaps, I should consider active temperature regulating sheets. I can only find options that look ineffective for my purposes.

###### 2019.6.17.2

I dined with my relatives yesterday night. They asked me a lot of questions, but I didn't really ask them equally interesting questions. Also, I forgot to congratulate the my cousin who just graduated in person.

I should've fit in my own questions or at least turned their questions back on them, and I should've congratulated my cousin in person.

A lack of questions could indicate a lack of interest in the other party. Asking questions definitely indicates an interest in the other party.

One super meal a day isn't that easy to do. Fats help your body feel full, so eating high fat foods make it a bit harder to reach your calorie and macro goals.

I should avoid single serving packaging. I want to be in charge of how much I eat. With single serving packaging, I'm forced to eat a single serving. If I try to eat fractional servings, I always end up finishing the rest. It's probably psychological.

After I finish the serving, I also have to get rid the packaging which quickly adds up to a ton of waste.

After reading Wikipedia's page on [cottage cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage_cheese), I'm now really interested in it. The cheese has an excellent nutrition profile for my goals and is also a bit sour.

I just finished JL Collin's [stock series](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/). It is excellent and detailed where it need to be. Now my question is whether I should read the rest of his blog and the other blogs he recommends. Well, what will I get out of it if I do? Not much.

I read the stock series, because I wanted to know more about investing. Now that I have a decent baseline, binging the rest of his blog seems inefficient when I could be spending it elsewhere doing other activities. I'm just going to subscribe to his blog and others and if their content interests me, consume them as they come.

I made it to Plat in League for the first time. Wow, I finally did it. I wonder how that changes things? Is there decay in Plat? My teammates are about the same, since my MMR didn't change that much. I suppose they're more apt to opening lanes. My rank doesn't matter. I want to climb high enough, so I can play with other players that I'll probably see again.

I looked around in my grocery store and I couldn't find cream or cottage cheese. I didn't look that hard, and I didn't even look in the cheese section. They should have them.

I'm starting to question why I'm trying to eat one banana a day. After some research, everything a banana offers from a nutritional standpoint can be easily found elsewhere. A banana's most notifiable feature is its convenience.

Can't I just make ice cream at home? Of course, I can. Ice cream is an icy cream churned cool to keep the ice crystals small. Most people make it with an ice cream machine, which is where I have a problem. Besides cold desserts, I can't find another good use for an ice cream maker. I'll stick with buying ice cream from the supermarket.
